# Schrittmacher-Simulation
Schrittmacher makes numeric simulations for students in school accessible and usable. It intents that children in the age of 12 can use simple mathematical relations in natural since to explore more complex situations and models. With a range of examples it gives startes an easy hook up and opens the field for self regualted learning as well as project orientated.

## Outlook
Further more cooperative learning is supported through the posibility of sharing mathematic models and combining them with each other. So a team of students can create complex mathematical models about the dynamic of such interacting systems, e.g. wheather and climate, physical systems with a range of acting forces or dempographic development. 

## Limitations 
The math behind the numeric simulations should be comprehensible for the students. For this reasean improved numeric algorithm are not in the focus. It's even seen as a chance to make stundents understand that a simulation is in a way nothing else but a approximation.
